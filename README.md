# md-babel.nvim

A NeoVim plugin to execute Markdown code blocks via [the `md-babel` command-line application](https://github.com/md-babel/swift-markdown-babel/).

> [!WARNING]
> This is a draft, work-in-progress, and untested yet. [Looking for help](https://github.com/md-babel/md-babel.nvim/issues), because getting started with nvim plugin development is quite the time commitment.
